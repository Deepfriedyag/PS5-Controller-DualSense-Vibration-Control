This Python script maps mouse and keyboard inputs to a PlayStation DualSense controller, triggering vibration feedback based on held buttons. It supports:
  * Mapping mouse buttons to controller buttons
  * Keyboard controls to adjust vibration intensity
  * Custom vibration patterns for face buttons (Cross, Circle, etc.)

Built-in Controls:
  * R2, R1, or Mouse Button 5 for constant vibration
  * "+" for increasing the intensity of the constant vibration
  * "-" for decreasing the intensity of the constant vibration
  * "*" for ending the program
  * Triangle, Circle, Cross, or Square for custom vibration patterns
